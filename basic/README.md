Use the DevContainers CLI to create and develop inside a container with basic development tools installed.

**Spoiler Alert**: I recommend not using the DevContainers CLI. Consider alternatives.

## Overview

Let's define and run a development container by layering in a publicly maintained Development Containers [*feature*][dev-containers-features] like the [Go language](https://github.com/bartventer/arch-devcontainer-features/tree/main/src/go) feature.

This is a basic starter example for getting up and running with DevContainers.


## Instructions

Follow these instructions to build and run the dev container.

1. Pre-requisites: Docker and the `devcontainer` CLI
   * I'm using Docker Desktop
   * I installed the `devcontainer` CLI from npm with the following command.
   * ```shell
     npm install -g @devcontainers/cli
     ```
2. Create and start a dev container:
   * ```shell
     devcontainer up --workspace-folder .
     ```
   * The way this works is kind of clever in my opinion. Notice how we didn't specify a container by name or ID. The `devcontainer` CLI uses something in the environment (I think its usual algorithm for locating a `devcontainer.json` file) and then finds a container with matching "Labels" metadata (I think) to connect to the right container. I think that's a neat convention to use. It might be obvious, but I never thought of it before. That said, it's surprising to me that [there isn't one command to do both start and connect][gh-issue-943].
3. Attach the container into a shell session:
   * ```shell
     devcontainer exec --workspace-folder . bash
     ```
4. Build and run the `hello.go` Go program
   * Run this command inside the shell session in the container.
   * ```shell
     go run hello.go
     ```
   * Altogether, it should look something like the following.
   * ```shell
     vscode âžœ /workspaces/dev-containers-playground/basic (devpod) $ go run hello.go
     Hello from a Go program! The host OS is linux/arm64
     ```
   * Great, now you're cooking. You're in a development environment with the tools you need, like the Go language toolchain.
   * (Why is 'vscode' in the prompt? What is it about the `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:debian-12` image that says "vscode" instead of a generic DevContainer container?)
5. Stop and remove the container:
    * Oddly, the [DevContainers CLI has never implemented the 'down' command][gh-issue-386]. See the related note later in this README. So you'll need to come up with the right container ID/name in your `docker stop` and `docker rm` commands.


## Warning: the DevContainers CLI is not fit for use

I recommend not using the DevContainers CLI for any development work.

I started exploring the DevContainers spec in 2022, and found that the tooling wasn't quite a fit for me yet. Although it was promising, especially because I had some success doing remote development in my favorite IDEs (JetBrains IDEs).

In 2025, I've found, so far, that the DevContainers ***CLI*** is still not a good fit for me (I'm still interested in the spec).

In 2022, I ran into what became my deal-breaker issue with the CLI: [forwardPorts configuration option not working](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli/issues/186). In 2025, I wouldn't have imagined this feature is still unimplemented. But, it's still unimplemented. Here are a couple of other unimplemented features in the same vein:

* [Down command #386][gh-issue-386]
* [Add the ability to start and exec into a devcontainer (docker run -it) #943][gh-issue-943]

These indicate a sign of "low/no investment" for the CLI project. A good rule-of-thumb for your own ventures is to also not invest in a project like this. These features have gone unimplemented longer than you would expect for a project with such a backing (Microsoft).

Also, the CLI is implemented in TypeScript and requires Node.js. This is an unusual choice for container-based tooling because it is typically dominated by Go. I found that the error messages and stacktraces of the CLI were verbose and indirect. This is generally more common in Node.js devtools compared to Go devtools (not always, to be fair!).

Thankfully, the [DevPod][dev-pod] project has a clean-room implementation of the DevContainers spec and is written in Go. I'm very interested to try this out.
